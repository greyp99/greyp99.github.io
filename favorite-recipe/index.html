            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Start with toasting your bread.</li>
                <li>Once toasted, use your spreaded butter on one side and spread your cream cheese of your choice on the other side of the bread each slice.</li>
                <li>Egg instructions:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Whisk the eggs for 2-3 minutes</li>
                        <li>Preheat your pan and spread butter around the pan and until it sizzles.</li>
			<li>Place the eggs into the preheated pan and put your salt and pepper on the eggs.</li>
                        <li>We are going for an omelet sandwich so wait for about a minute until you can flip the eggs to one side of the pan.</li>
			<li>After flipping the eggs set it asside and prepare for the bacon</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Preheat a pan for the bacon and start flipping multiple times every 10-20 seconds until crispy. Once finished place the bacon onto a paper towel</li>
                <li>Finally, you're ready to assemble your sandwhich, putting your eggs on top of one side of the bread with the cream, putting the bacon on the egg, and finally the last bread slice ontop, finishing your bacon and egg sandwich.</li>
